    "\n",
    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;$ HTML Boilerplate, often referred to as an \"HTML template\" or \"HTML starter code,\" is a basic structure for an HTML document that provides a starting point for creating web pages. boilerplate is a pre-prepared library of code that can be copied and used as a starting point to start building web projects. It includes a basic structure for an HTML document, like the typical html, head, and body tags, as well as links to CSS and JavaScript files. It typically includes essential elements and metadata required for a well-structured and functional webpage. Developers commonly use HTML boilerplates as a foundation to build upon because they ensure consistency and best practices.\n",
